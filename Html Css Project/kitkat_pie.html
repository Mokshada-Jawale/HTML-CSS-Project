                <br>
                <p>KitKat Bars: (Obvi) They make up the base of pie that contain everything in.
                      I don’t know about you, but I’ll take a crust of chocolate bars over pie crust any day. 
                       Chopped KitKats are also foldeded throughout the ice cream filling for that iconic snap it’s known for, and a pop of crunch. 
                     It’s also piled over the top to make the pie look all pretty.
                     <br>
                    Salted Caramel Sauce:  It’s that special touch that makes the pie extra delicious, so don’t skip it! 
                     It’s probably the most involved part of the recipe, but with the video below, you’ll hopefully find it so simple to make.
                       Feel free to substitute store-bought caramel sauce if you prefer.
                        You can also omit it altogether, and use caramel-swirl vanilla ice cream instead of plain vanilla to get the same effect.
                    <br>
                    Vanilla Ice Cream:  Choose you favorite brand of ice cream here. 
                     It goes without saying that the better the quality, the better the pie will turn out. 
                      Go for plain vanilla if using homemade or store-bought salted caramel sauce. 
                       Alternatively, you can use caramel-swirl vanilla ice cream, if you’d rather skip the caramel making/buying.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>It’s too simple, I’m almost embarrassed to call this a recipe.
                    You first begin by placing chunks of KitKat in a food processor.
                    <br>
                    Then process until the KitKat breaks into medium crumbs.
You’ll then press the crumbs into a tart or pie dish. 
 I prefer to use one with a removable bottom, which make it easier to unmold the pie later.
And Voila!  Pie crust done ✔️  

Just keep it in the freezer, as you prepare the filling.
<br>
Now moving on to the filling…all you need to do is fold in chopped KitKat bars into slightly softened vanilla ice cream.
  Take care not to let the ice cream fully melt, as that will affect the texture.
You’ll then gently stir in salted caramel sauce (which you can see how to make your own at the bottom of the post) to create ribbons and swirls.
<br>
Transfer about half of the ice cream mixture into the frozen pie crust, smoothing the top into an even layer.
Then scoop the remaining ice cream over the surface.
 (If the ice cream has softened to the extent of not being scoop-able, simply freeze the remaining ice cream in the bowl until firm,
  then scoop). 
 Then off to the freezer it goes to firm up!
