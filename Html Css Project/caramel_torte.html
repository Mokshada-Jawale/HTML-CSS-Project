                <p> For the Pastry Layers
                    <br>
                    340 g (2 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour
                    <br>
                    30 g (2 tablespoons) white granulated sugar
                    <br>
                    115 g (4 oz) unsalted butter, at room temperature
                    <br>
                    125 ml (1/2 cup) pure cream (35% fat)
                    <br>
                    1 egg, lightly beaten
                    <br>
                    40 (1/4 cup) toasted or sugared almonds, for garnish
                    <br>
                    
                    For the Caramel Sauce
                    <br>
                    295 g (1 1/3 cups) white granulated sugar
                    <br>
                    200 ml (3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon) milk
                    <br>
                    3 g (1/4 teaspoon) baking soda
                    <br>
                    125 g (4 1/2 oz) butter
                    <br>
                    2 g (1/2 teaspoon) vanilla extract
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 170 ºC (325 ºF). Line three or four large baking trays.
                    <br>

                    Put the flour and sugar into a large bowl. Using your fingertips, rub in the butter until it resembles coarse crumbs.
                     In a separate bowl, whip the cream until slightly thickened and stir the egg.
                     <br>

                      Add this to the flour mixture and combine until it just comes together as a dough.
                    Divide the dough into 9 pieces. On a lightly floured surface roll out, one piece at a time, 
                    to a thickness of 1 - 2 mm (1/32 - 1/16 inch).
                    <br>
                     Using a 24 cm (9 1/2 inch) circle as a guide (the base of a springform cake tin works well) cut a circle from the dough. 
                    Lift carefully and place on a prepared tray. Continue until 9 circles have been rolled, cut out and place on the trays.
                    Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 20 - 30 minutes.
                    <br>
                     Check regularly as different shelves of the oven may cook at different temperatures.
                    To make the caramel sauce, melt the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until all the grains are dissolved and
                     it is golden brown caramel. Do not stir or move it around, and watch it carefully.
                     <br>
                    Warm the milk a little, stir in the bicarbonate of soda, then slowly pour the milk into the caramel a little at a time, 
                    stirring constantly. Don't worry if the mixture seizes, it will melt again. Bring to the boil over low heat until slightly thickened.
                     Add the butter and vanilla and stir until combined and thick. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly until thick enough to spoon onto the pastry layers.
                    To assemble, place a drop of the sauce on a cake plate and cover with the first disc of pastry.
                    <br>
                     Spoon.2 tablespoons of caramel over the disc and spread thinly from edge to edge. 
                     Top with the next disc and a layer of caramel and continue until all the discs and caramel are used,
                      making sure you keep enough caramel for the top. Spread the remaining caramel over the top disc and garnish with the nuts. 
                      Leave the torte to sit, covered, at least overnight before serving.
